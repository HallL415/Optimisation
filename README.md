The files Optimisation_popn, Functions and Parameters are required to run the code, optionally Forster_FGR may be added for some additional comparisons using Fermi's golden rule (FGR). The Parameters file must be 
modified to select the system you wish to investigate, allowing for paremeter choice such as coupling strength, phonon coupling strengths etc.
Currently, the Linear Polarisation (LP) for QD-Cavity, QD-QD and QD-QD-Cavity systems may be obtained, although the QD-QD LP requires the cavity mode to be enabled and then coupling to said cavity mode set to 0. 
Additionally the Population dynamics can be obtained for a QD-QD system with Foerster coupling (dipole-dipole type coupling). 
Also contained in the code are various sections for convergence tests, and the extraction of exponential fit paremeters to the long time regions of the data. As well as some extrapolation methods to extract the 
expected parameter values for infinite neighbours (exact calculation).
